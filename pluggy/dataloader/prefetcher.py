host->device prefetching for the training loop.

the DataLoader (with num_workers > 0) already prefetches collated CPU batches
into a queue, so next(iter) usually pops a ready batch. what's still serial is
the host->device copy: by default it runs on the compute stream and blocks the
next step. CUDAPrefetcher issues that copy on a side stream so it overlaps the
previous step's kernels, and only makes the compute stream wait right before it
needs the batch.

there's a problem with how we save/load for checkpoining, will skip one batch
if we naively resume with N + 1

    overlaps the host->device copy of batch N+1 with the compute of batch N.

    the copy runs on a dedicated CUDA stream so it doesn't serialize behind the
    default (compute) stream. right before we hand a batch to the caller we make
    the compute stream wait on the copy stream, and record_stream the tensors so
    the caching allocator doesn't recycle their memory while the async copy is
    still in flight.

    requires the source tensors to be in pinned memory (pin_memory=True on the
    DataLoader) -- otherwise .to(non_blocking=True) silently falls back to a
    blocking copy and nothing overlaps.
