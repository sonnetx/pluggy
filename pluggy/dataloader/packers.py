"""
some food for thought: current tests show that best fit bin packing
only save ~0.04% of tokens, but this could be an artifact of climbmix
not having very long documents

packing strategies for the dataloader .map step, behind one shared interface so
they're interchangeable and benchmarkable.

a packer takes a map-batch of docs, concatenates their token ids into a single
stream with an eos between docs, then slices the stream into back-to-back
seq_len blocks. every emitted row is exactly seq_len -- no padding, no attention
mask downstream. the tail remainder (< seq_len) of each map-batch is dropped.
carrying that remainder into the next batch is a separate algorithm (different
output), so it lives in its own class rather than as a "variant" here.

the variants below differ only in *how* they concatenate + slice (python lists
vs numpy vs torch). given the same docs they emit identical blocks, which the
benchmark suite asserts before trusting any timing. tokenization is shared in
the base __call__, so pack() -- the only thing that differs -- is the only axis
under test.

all packers are top-level classes (not closures) so DataLoader workers can
pickle them, which forkserver/spawn require (py3.14 default on linux).

    remainder; those remainders -- together with whole short docs -- are packed
    into bins by best-fit-decreasing so we waste as little bin capacity as

    drop the tail and does NOT emit identical blocks -- different output is the
    whole point. so it lives outside the equality group: the benchmark checks it
    against token-conservation invariants instead (see BESTFIT_PACKERS).

    a segment tree over remaining-space buckets (0..seq_len) gives O(log seq_len)
    best fit: leaf s holds s iff some open bin has exactly s free, internal nodes
    hold the max, so search(c) returns the smallest space >= c that fits.
