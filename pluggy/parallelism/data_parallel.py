ddp: replicate the model along the mesh's dp axis and keep replicas in
lockstep by averaging grads across the axis after every backward.

- buckets in reverse `model.parameters()` order, which approximates backward
  completion order, so early buckets fill (and their all-reduce launches)
  while the rest of backward is still computing. bucket fill order is the
  hook firing order, which is identical across ranks (same graph, same
  engine schedule), so nccl sees the same collective order everywhere.
- a bucket of small params shares one preallocated flat buffer: grads are
  copied in with a single foreach launch, `.grad` is repointed at views of
  the buffer, and the buffer is all-reduced. the reduced values are then
  already what the optimizer reads -- no copy back out.
- a param at or over the bucket cap gets a bucket of its own and is
  all-reduced in place via its `.grad` directly: no buffer, no copy. this is
  the tied-embedding grad (622MB fp32 at qwen3-0.6B), where a staging copy
  would cost real time and transient memory.
- `sync()` (call between backward and optimizer.step) waits on all handles.
  there is no non-overlap mode: launching from hooks is the only thing that
  makes grad sync affordable on this box, so it is not a knob.
- `requires_sync` is the no_sync switch for grad accumulation (roadmap 1.3).
  set it False for the first K-1 microbatches: the hook returns immediately,
  without decrementing any bucket counter, so nothing is launched over a
  partially accumulated grad and no bucket is re-armed mid-step. set it True
  for the last microbatch, whose hooks fire over the fully accumulated grads
  and launch the all-reduces exactly once per step. it is a plain attribute
  rather than a context manager because the trainer's loop is the only caller
  and the last microbatch has to sit outside any such scope anyway.

zero_grad interplay: the trainer's `optimizer.zero_grad()` (set_to_none=True)
drops the buffer views, so each backward the engine allocates fresh grads and
the hook copies them in. set_to_none=False also works (the engine then
accumulates straight into the views and the copy degenerates to a no-op).
multiple backwards per sync is exactly the accumulation case above and needs
`requires_sync` handled correctly -- sync() asserts loudly if a bucket never
filled, which is what catches getting it wrong.

grad clipping is deliberately NOT here: it is a per-step function over params,
not a lifecycle hook on the model, and FSDP2/TP need the same one. it lives in
`core/grad_helper.py` and runs after sync() (before it, the flat buffers still
hold un-reduced local grads); it writes through the `.grad` views, which is
what the optimizer then reads.

one DDP instance per model: hooks are registered once and never removed.
